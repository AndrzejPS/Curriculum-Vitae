The (Un)Classic Tic-Tac-Toe Game it's a digital version of classic game Tic-Tac-Toe,
however this program enables you to play on chosen board size with chosen emblems
(very helpful, if you are bored with the old classical setting).

There are two game modes, both with a single and a multiplayer variant.
The first one is a Tic-Tac-Toe with basic rules, and the second is a "Crazy mode", where, after each player's turn, one field is randomly chosen and cleared. Obviously the outcome would be probably unfair in this scenario, therefore I think "Crazy mode" could make games much more intensive, memorable and funny.

The whole game was made by me, AndrzejPS
